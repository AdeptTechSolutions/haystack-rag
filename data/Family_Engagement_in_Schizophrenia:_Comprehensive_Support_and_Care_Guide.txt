Im John Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Caregiver Action Network, and we hope you find todays webinar helpful. We will concentrate on schizophrenia as an illness and the challenges family caregivers face, emphasizing the importance of early family engagement in the diagnosis and treatment process.Today, well hear from three presenters, each offering unique perspectives and expertise. Feel free to submit questions at any time during the 90 minutes using the chat function. If we dont get to your question, well follow up afterward.Caregiver Action Network is a nonprofit organization that serves the nations 90 million family caregivers, providing free resources and support. Todays focus on mental health challenges, especially schizophrenia, reflects the feedback weve received from families. We know mental health issues affect the whole family, and with schizophrenia, patients may even refuse the involvement of a family caregiver. Early family engagement, however, can lead to much better outcomes in the long term, as treatment started before or after a psychotic episode has a higher likelihood of success.There are several treatment options that caregivers may not be aware of, including long-acting injectables that can be administered monthly or even every three months. This provides alternatives to daily medication and may help families who struggle with ensuring their loved one stays on track with treatment.We also introduced a resource calledBlueprint for Families of Loved Ones with Mental Health Issues., which addresses four main areas: medication management, privacy issues like HIPAA, tips for communicating with healthcare professionals, and connecting with other caregivers. Additionally, we recommendChoicesInRecovery.com, a comprehensive resource sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which offers useful tools for caregivers and patients alike.Our first presenter is Paul Gionfriddo, CEO ofMental Health America. Paul brings a personal perspective, having a son with schizophrenia, and will discuss the importance of early identification and intervention before stage four mental illness. He shares his experience with his son, Tim, who showed symptoms at age 5 but wasnt diagnosed until 16, highlighting the critical role early detection could play in changing outcomes.Next, well hear from Chrissa Hickey, a parent and advocate for mental health, whose son Timothy was diagnosed with childhood-onset schizophrenia at age 11. Chrissa talks about the struggles of raising a child with severe mental illness and how earlier diagnosis and intervention have helped stabilize her son, who now lives in his own apartment.Finally, Isa Kelleher from theNational Council for Behavioral Healthwill introduceMental Health First Aid, a groundbreaking program designed to teach non-clinicians how to provide initial support during a mental health crisis. Isa emphasizes the importance of identifying symptoms early and discusses the importance of educating families on the treatment options available, such as long-acting injectables and therapy.Throughout this webinar, we hope you gain insights into how family engagement, early diagnosis, and treatment can make a substantial difference in managing schizophrenia. Thank you for joining us, and remember to explore the resources weve shared for continued support.Understanding Familys Critical Role in Schizophrenia ManagementSchizophrenia is a complex mental health condition that profoundly impacts not just individuals, but entire families.
