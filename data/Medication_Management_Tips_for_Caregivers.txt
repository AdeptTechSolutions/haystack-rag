People with chronic diseases or disabilities take more medications than any other group of patients. With the number of medications some patients take, the issue of medication management and can easily become overwhelming. Good health outcomes are three times less likely for patients who do not take medications correctly as compared to those that do. Improper use of medications causes 18 million emergency room visits per year.Maintain an up-to-date medication listKeep an up-to-date list of all the medications doctors have prescribed for your care recipient. Also, list over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Be sure to list the name, dosage, and frequency of the medication, the reason for taking it, any dosing directions, the start date, and when appropriate, the end date.For prescription drugs, add the name and phone number of the prescribing doctor and the pharmacy that filled the prescription.Include your loved ones name and emergency contact information. Also, note any allergies or other significant medical information.Make multiple copies: one for you to carry, one for your care recipients patient file, one on the refrigerator for paramedics to find in an emergency, and one for the primary doctor.A simple computer-based document is one of the easiest ways to keep the record current.Translate hand-written prescriptionsDont be shy about asking all doctors to translate their handwriting so you can have a record of what they prescribed and whyWrite the condition treated on each medicine bottleYou might find that your care recipient is taking three different pills for the same condition, each prescribed by a different physician. That may be precisely what is needed, but it is a red flag to alert you to ask questions.Use the same pharmacy when possibleIf you do, there will be an official record of all prescription medications over an extended period. This can be a vital timesaver during an emergency.Develop a strong rapport with your pharmacist and let him/her know you value their advice. The pharmacist is a great resource. Ask your pharmacists advice about over-the-counter medications and if they may react with prescription medications.Understand potential side effects and interactions and monitor interactionsAsk the doctor and pharmacist about potential side effects and interactions with other drugs, vitamins, or foods.Learn what to do if a dose is accidentally skipped.Come up with an easy way to manage medications dailyUse pill boxes or other technology to monitor and manage dosesUse auto-refill programs when availableWhat Should be on the Medication List?Name of drug generic and brand namesDoseStart and stop datesWhat the pill/capsule/liquid looks likeA record of any side effects experiencedWhat the drug is treatingInstructionsHow and when to take the medicationWhat not to do when taking the medicationOver the Counter medications and supplements with their dosesDrug and other allergiesDrugs to which you experienced a negative reaction (couldnt tolerate it)Recently completed prescriptionsName/contact info of prescribers (physician/physician assistant/nurse practitioner, etc.)Name/contact info for the pharmacy that filled the prescription(s)Safe Disposal of Unused MedicationsOption 1: Returning to PharmacySome pharmacies, clinics, or even hospitals may accept unused medications. You can check for a facility atwww.disposemymeds.org. Some (but not all) police departments or fire stations will accept unused medication on National Prescription Take Back Day, on October 27.Option 2:Mail-in EnvelopesMany pharmacies sell postage-paid special envelopes for you to return unused medications to a safe disposal facility.Option 3: Disposal KiosksMany pharmacies have secure kiosks where you can safely deposit unused medications. Remove personal information, and drop unused medicines in the slot!Option 4: NeutralizingPurchase specialty charcoal-activated medication disposal bags. After placing the medications in the bag, add water and seal. The drugs, including opioids, will be rendered inert and inactive. These bags can then be placed safely in the trash, and you can have peace of mind knowing that the drugs will not enter the water supply or be easily abused or diverted.NOTE:Mostmedicationsshould not be flushed, but there are a small number that should. Check with the pharmacist to find out if medications should or should not be flushed. Be extremely cautious if you choose to place unused medications in the trash. Children, pets, and those addicted to opioids can fish medications out of the trash, even if combined with coffee grounds or kitty litter.Effective medication management is essential for caregiver success. By maintaining a comprehensive medication list, understanding medication interactions, and safely disposing of unused medications, caregivers can better support their loved ones health and safety.
