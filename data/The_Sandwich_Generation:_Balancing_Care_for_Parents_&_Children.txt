According to the Pew Research Center, almost half of adults aged 40 to 59 find themselves part of this growing group, balancing caregiving roles for two generations.Interestingly, while men and women both fall into this category, women bear a more significant share of the responsibilities. According to Pew Research, 60% of sandwich generation caregivers are women, and on average, they spend 45 minutes more each day on caregiving tasks than men.In Hispanic communities, nearly 31% of individuals with children also have at least one parent over 65, creating an even more challenging scenario of balancing cultural expectations, financial obligations, and practical care.The Types of Care Provided by the Sandwich GenerationSandwich generation caregivers provide various types of support to both their children and aging parents, including:Financial Assistance:Many caregivers manage their parents finances or help them with medical expenses.Emotional Support:Caregivers often provide emotional stability and reassurance to both children and aging parents.Daily Living Support:Some help aging parents with activities of daily living (ADLs), including meal preparation, medication management, and transportation.The aging population is growing, meaning more caregivers are likely to find themselves providing such assistance as their parents age.Challenges Faced by Sandwich Generation CaregiversCaring for two generations simultaneously can be overwhelming. A Pew Research study reported that 31% of sandwich generation caregivers feel constantly pressed for time. Balancing caregiving with a career is particularly challenging, as caregivers spend around 30 hours a week on caregiving duties, often at the expense of their professional responsibilities.Financial stress is another challenge. On average, sandwich generation caregivers spend about $10,000 per year on caregiving expenses, which can affect long-term financial stability, including retirement savings. AARP found that 15% of caregivers support both their children and their aging parents financially, with 30% of caregivers struggling to meet their expenses.Tips for Managing Sandwich Caregiving ResponsibilitiesHere are some practical steps to help ease the burden of sandwich caregiving:Delegate Tasks:Dont try to do everything on your own. Ask siblings or extended family to help with caregiving duties or take advantage of community resources for seniors, likeBenefitsCheckUp, which helps caregivers find available support.Communicate with Your Employer:Many caregivers are eligible for job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Talk to your employer about flexible working arrangements that can help you balance caregiving and professional responsibilities.Stay Organized:Keeping track of both your childrens and your parents needs can be overwhelming. Utilize caregiving apps or tools likeLotsa Helping Handsto coordinate tasks and stay on top of doctors appointments and medication schedules.Prioritize Self-Care:Caregivers often sacrifice their well-being for others. Its essential to schedule time for self-care activities such as exercise, reading, or catching up with friends to avoid burnout. TheFamily Caregiver Allianceoffers a range of resources to help caregivers find balance.Managing the Financial Impact of Sandwich CaregivingFinances are a significant stressor for sandwich generation caregivers, especially when balancing the costs of raising children and caring for aging parents. Creating a budget that takes both immediate caregiving expenses and long-term savings into account is crucial. You may also want to explore financial resources likeAARPs guide on Sandwich Generation Caregivingto find support for managing costs.Navigating Emotional SupportEmotional burnout is a common concern for caregivers in the sandwich generation. The demands of caregiving for both children and parents can lead to feelings of isolation, guilt, and stress. Connecting with others who are in similar situations through support groups or online communities, like theCaregiver Action Networks Facebook group, can help alleviate emotional strain.Caring for Both GenerationsWhile the challenges of sandwich caregiving can seem insurmountable, its essential to seek help when needed. Whether its financial assistance, emotional support, or simply asking for help from friends and family, you dont have to navigate caregiving alone. With the right resources, you can successfully care for both generations without sacrificing your own well-being.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.
