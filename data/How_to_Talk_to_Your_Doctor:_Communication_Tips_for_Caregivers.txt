Welcome to NFCAs Communicating Effectively with Healthcare Professionals program. NFCA educates, supports, empowers, and speaks up for millions of Americans who care for loved ones with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or the frailties of old age.NFCA addresses the common needs and concerns of all family caregivers, regardless of their loved ones age or diagnosis, in order to build their confidence and capabilities and help transform the quality of their lives. We are grateful to the National Association of Chain Drugstores Foundation and the Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation for sponsoring this OnDemand version of the Communicating Effectively program.We hope this presentation will help you appreciate the important role you play on your family members healthcare team. In addition, youll learn how good communication techniques can make a difference in the care your family member receives. Youll also learn strategies to better prepare for medical visits, whether in your physicians office or in the emergency room.As a family caregiver, you need to know that you are not alone. Rosalyn Carter said it best, There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. As the population continues to age, youll be hard-pressed to meet someone who doesnt know a family caregiver or is not one themselves.Poor communication with healthcare providers can cause mishaps or errors in treatment. For example, medication errors could lead to very serious consequences. In addition, opportunities for improving care can be missed due to problems with communication.The Communicating Effectively curriculum has been proven to change the way family caregivers behave in healthcare environments. Research indicates that caregivers are more confident in their communication interactions, and they change their behaviors in relation to preparing for medical visits, what they do during visits, and how they follow up. This curriculum promotes better healthcare outcomes for their family members and themselves.As a family caregiver, you are part of the healthcare team that cares for your loved one. In addition to you and your care recipient, other teammates include the primary care physician, nurses, pharmacists, medical specialists such as oncologists and hematologists, home healthcare aides, social workers, various therapists, and clergy. A whole network of individuals exists to assist you in caring for your family member.How can a family caregiver keep track of all these team members? One suggestion is to purchase a business card holder. As you interact with the caregiving team, you can collect their business cards, write on the back what their role is, and store them in the cardholder.On any team, there are various dynamics in relation to power. As a family caregiver, you have a special kind of poweryou know your family member better than anyone else on the healthcare team. Realizing your power is important because you have valuable information to share.Healthcare communication can be influenced by the relationship between the caregiver and their loved one. Its important not only to have clear and effective communication with healthcare professionals but also with your family member.The Communicating Effectively model is based on four key principles: establishing presence, participating actively, building mutual understanding, and encouraging collaboration. These strategies will improve your communication with healthcare providers and your overall ability to communicate with others.An important step in healthcare encounters is establishing presence. A person with presence might be seen as a force to be reckoned with or someone noticed by others. By staying in the moment, you remain calm and collected, allowing yourself to communicate your concerns and needs regarding your family members care.When you establish your presence, youre fully present mentally and physically. You can hear whats being said, process it, write it down, ask questions, and respond appropriately. These steps allow you to maintain a strong sense of self as an important and vital member of the healthcare team.When establishing your presence during a first meeting with a healthcare professional, you might want to shake hands and introduce yourself. For example: Hello, Dr. Smith. My name is Lori, and Im the daughter of Paul. He lives with me, and I am his primary caregiver. This statement lets them know your role and that you are an important part of your family members treatment.Rapport is also essential. Its important to participate actively in healthcare encounters, as research shows that patients who are more active in their care have better health outcomes. Being prepared, clearly stating your purpose, and writing down concerns are all part of this process.Ask questions, clarify incorrect assumptions, and be assertive. Skillful assertiveness will enhance your relationships and build understanding, while aggression can destroy relationships. Assertiveness helps you communicate your needs and concerns respectfully.Active listening involves paying attention to verbal and non-verbal cues like body language, tone, and facial expressions. It helps build mutual understanding and is a crucial component of effective communication.The Importance of Effective Healthcare CommunicationAs a caregiver, your role in your loved ones healthcare journey is pivotal. Effective communication with healthcare professionals can mean the difference between adequate and exceptional care. The Caregiver Action Network recognizes that caregivers are essential members of the healthcare team, with a unique perspective that can significantly impact medical outcomes.
