I take care of my husband, Richard Africk. And he has COPD.There are several things that Ive had to take over since hes been diagnosed. The first and the most devastating one for Richard wasI had to drive. I had to do all the driving for us.I have to do all the shopping myself. He used to go shopping with me, and we would both, uh, pick out things, whatever we wanted.I have to do that myself now. It makes it difficult. I have to bring the groceries up. Its more physical too. Not only is it different mentally but its physically more taxing.Ive always been the kind of person who does things myself for myself. And with the progression of his COPD, I have found that I have to have some help. So I did get a caregiver for a few hours a day, just as a relief. I still feel totally responsible for him. Ah, hes my husband of 61 years.The one that Ive also found very helpful is the V.A. V.A. offers caregivers for depending on the situation, how much care the person needs.And that is amazing. Theres no charge for that. And its absolutely amazing that you can have somebody to go grocery shopping, to get your hair done, to, to do whatever you need to do, to go to your own doctor appointments. For years I was taking him with me to my doctor appointments, because I didnt want to leave him home alone. I dont have to do that. So that is the best resource of anyone whos been a veteran, to definitely call the V.A.As a caregiver, Im not surprised at many things that I do. Because its my nature.The one thing I did realize is that whatever Im going through is worse for him. Its worse for many people. So I can do this. I have to do this. My only other solution is to give up. And I dont give up.Well, I prioritize. And whatever need is the most urgent gets taken care of first. This is how I am able to take care of his needs and my needs. And I think this is important because I dont want to completely neglect my own needs.I dont know that you always know whats ahead in COPD. So as much as you want to be prepared, the best thing I could say is, realize that at some time things are going to change, and be flexible.I dont blame him for anything. He is, believe me, suffering more than I suffer. And its his positive attitude that keeps me going. He always has a smile.Taking a Time-outHear a woman share how she finds time for herself after becoming a caregiver changed her life.WATCH VIDEOHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.
