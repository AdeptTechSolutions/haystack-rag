My personal journey began in early 2017 when I first noticed unusual changes in my husbands behavior. By 2018, we received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) caused by Alzheimers diseasea moment that fundamentally transformed our lives.Watching an intelligent, capable man gradually lose his short-term memory has been heart-wrenching. Simple tasks that were once second naturemanaging finances, conducting household repairs, making decisionshave become increasingly challenging. Even choosing dinner, once a straightforward decision, now fluctuates unpredictably.The uncertainty is terrifying: Will he remember my name in six months? How long will this mild cognitive impairment stage last?Empowering MCI Patients Through Community SupportIn response to our diagnosis, I channeled my grief into action. In 2020, I initiated a support program designed to assist MCI patients in maximizing their cognitive abilities despite limited treatment options. Our weekly ninety-minute sessions have become a beacon of hope for those navigating this challenging diagnosis.Our program focuses on holistic cognitive health, incorporating:Memory-enhancing gamesPuzzle-solving activitiesPhysical exerciseNutritional educationWhat started with just six participants has now grown to fill two church rooms, with over 20 attendees joining weeklya testament to the critical need for community support in Alzheimers care.The Critical Challenge: Medicare and Alzheimers Treatment AccessThe landscape of Alzheimers treatment is rapidly evolving. By 2050, an estimated 13 million people will be affected by this devastating disease. Approximately 3,000 patients transition from MCI to more advanced stagesdaily. While an innovative early-stage Alzheimers drug recently received FDA approval, access remains a significant barrier.TheCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS) must address these access challenges. Current policies create unnecessary hurdles for patients seeking treatment:Requiring physicians to participate in CMS-approved registriesImplementing additional data collection stepsCreating uncertain review processesPotentially discouraging patient participation through complex requirementsThese barriers translate into real-world delays that can dramatically impact patient outcomes and family experiences.A Call for Compassionate Policy ChangeMy plea to CMS is simple yet urgent: treat Alzheimers medications with the same accessibility afforded to treatments for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Time is not a luxury for Alzheimers patientsit is a precious, rapidly diminishing resource.While my husbands diagnosis came later in life, allowing us treasured moments like meeting our four grandchildren, many families face earlier, more aggressive progressions. Some patients might have mere months before the disease significantly impacts their quality of life.We need policy changes that prioritize patient access, reduce bureaucratic barriers, and recognize the critical importance of timely intervention. Although current treatments may not help my husband, they could provide hope and additional time for countless other families fighting this disease.By Ellen Steger, Caregiver AdvocateGreensboro, GAHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.
