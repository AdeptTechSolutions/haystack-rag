If so, you are not alone! This is one of the most frequently asked questions. Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with a one-size-fits-all answer.You have the best chance of being paid to be a family caregiver if you care for a veteran. It also applies if your loved one is eligible for Medicaid, but other possibilities exist. These include long-term care policies, tax credits, and reimbursements for family caregiving expenses.Getting paid for caring for a loved one with VA benefitsIf your loved one is a veteran of the U.S. military, there are four plans for which they might qualify. VA benefits change periodically, so checking for updates is always a good idea. It is important to stay informed about the latest VA benefits for caregivers.Veteran-Directed Careis a program through the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans who are enrolled in a Veterans Health Administration healthcare system and need nursing care but want to live at home. Participants are given a monthly budget and can choose the goods and services most helpful to them. This includes a caregiver to assist them with activities of daily living tailored to their specific needs.Aid and Attendance(A&A) benefits support veterans who qualify for a VA pension, having served on active duty for at least 90 days during a time of war and received an honorable discharge. Veterans must meet one of these criteria: require assistance with daily activities, be confined to bed due to a disability, have minimal eyesight, or live in a nursing home due to a physical or mental incapacity.Veteran Caregiver Benefits: Housebound & Assistance ProgramsHousebound benefitsare for veterans receiving a military pension who are housebound due to a permanent disability. Please note that under this program, adult children and other relatives can become paid caregivers for family members. However, this program does not allow spouses to be paid caregivers for their family members. The application is the same as for A&A benefitsbut you cannot receive both simultaneously.TheProgram of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregiversis for caregivers of veterans who need help with activities of daily living due to an injury or illness sustained in the line of duty on or before May 7, 1975, or on or after September 11, 2001. To be eligible, veterans must meet certain disability and need criteria. Stipends are based on the federal pay rate for where the veteran lives. Under this program, the caregiver must be 18 years or older and can be a spouse.For more information on caregiver benefits for veterans, visit theVA Caregiver Support pageor call its hotline at 855-260-3274.Getting paid to be a family caregiver through MedicaidMedicaid is a federally funded state program that assists with healthcare costs for people with limited income. It covers low-income adults, older adults, and individuals with significant disabilities across the United States. This may be a good time to mention that Medicaid and Medicare are different programs.To be eligible for Medicaid, your loved one must meet one of the following criteria:Be considered low-income according to the guidelines in the state where they have established residence. To qualify, one must make around 138% of the poverty limit or lower.Be considered medically needymeaning that their health needs are intensive and may require overwhelming expense.Medicaid in some states allows older adults to choose and pay their caregivers, including adult children or spouses. This flexibility varies by state, offering options for individuals needing caregiving support through Medicaid plans.Home and community-based waivershelp older adults who would rather receive in-home care. Qualifications vary by state; generally, older adults must require care provided by skilled nursing or assisted living facilities. To qualify, there must be a care plan, and in-home care costs cannot exceed residential care costs.Self-Directed Care Programs for Seniors and Medicaid OptionsSelf-directed person assistant servicesallow seniors to hire caregiversusually family members or close friends. Under the program, the participant must develop a care plan with the caregiver and establish a backup plan if the selected caregiver can no longer continue in their caregiver role.Community First Choiceis similar to the other Medicaid programs. Under the plan, seniors can manage their own careincluding paying family or friends for their caregiving services. This plan was established under the Affordable Care Act and is available in nine states: AK, CA, CT, MD, MT, NY, OR, TX, and WA.For more information on Medicaid, go to:https://www.medicaid.gov/.Getting paid for caregiving for a parent through tax credits and reimbursementsThere are several tax credits and reimbursements available for caregivers. If your parents gross annual incomenot including society securityis less than $4,300 and you cover more than half the support cost, claiming them as a dependent may be possible. Even if these criteria dont apply, deducting the majority of care expenses from your taxes might be possible. It would be best if you were sure to consult an accountant or tax attorney. The regulations vary by state, and some state-funded caregiver payment programs do not allow family members to claim their elderly loved ones as dependents on their taxes. These options may not be financially beneficial for you in the long run.Getting paid for caregiving by your loved oneOne possible way for your loved one to pay you for caregiving is if they have long-term care insurance. Policies vary by company, but many long-term care policies allow payment for in-home caregiving. The insurance company can tell you if a family member can provide this care.Another option is if your loved one is of sound mind and financially capable, they can pay you directly. Consider drafting a personal care contract outlining compensation and caregiving services. You may want to include other immediate family members in the discussion to avoid surprises or misunderstandings later.You should also consult an elder care attorney to ensure the contract complies with tax laws. Any compensation received is considered income and should be reported on your taxes. Suppose your loved one is currently on Medicaid or may be in the future. In that case, you want to ensure that any payments made to you dont violate their eligibility requirements or Medicaid regulations. Other interested parties, such as siblings, should also approve the agreement. This could help avoid any hurt feelings or disagreements regarding issues of inheritance.Additional Financial & Legal ToolsHow to Become a Paid Family CaregiverRead MoreMedicare Help Senior Patients and Caregivers for DecadesRead MoreWhy Medicare Coverage is Critical to CaregiversRead MoreFinancial Help for Caregivers: SilverBills Partnership and NIH StudyRead More12NextLoad More PostsHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.
