Attend support group meetings, seek help when needed, and explore respite care options to manage caregiver stress effectively.Understand the New NormalRecognize that both you and your loved one will need to adapt to new circumstances. Discuss any changes in mood or behavior with the healthcare team to identify if they are related to the stroke or indicate other issues.Watch for Warning SignsMonitor for symptoms such as muscle spasms, severe headaches, fatigue, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations.
