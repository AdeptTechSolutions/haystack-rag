Welcome to the National Family Caregivers Associations Safe and Sound program. NFCA is the nations leading organization for family caregivers, reaching across all life stages and diagnoses to address the common needs and concerns of caregivers. NFCA provides services and programs in education, community, and advocacy to help family caregivers improve the health and well-being of themselves and their loved ones.This presentation is designed to enable family caregivers to be effective members of their care recipients medication management team. It helps caregivers improve adherence to medication instructions, prevent problems from arising, and manage their own medication health as well. We are grateful to the National Association of Chain Drugstores Foundation for sponsoring this OnDemand version of the Safe and Sound program. We also thank the programs original supporters: Nardis Intel Health, eii Home Instead Senior Care, Pharma, Genworth Financial Health Services, and the Amera Group Foundation.We hope that after viewing this program, you will be able to identify the members of your medication safety team, understand when and where medication problems are likely to occur, and gain valuable safety tips to reduce the possibility of medication-related issues.People with chronic illnesses take more medications than anyone else. Medical professionals have a language all their own, and understanding some key terms can help you navigate medication management: **Medication adherence**: The extent to which patients take medications (both prescribed and over-the-counter) as instructed by healthcare providers. **Adverse drug reaction**: An unintended and negative reaction to a medication. **Medication error**: A preventable event that leads to patient harm or inappropriate medication use. **Medication reconciliation**: The act of reviewing all medications a patient is taking before prescribing a new one to avoid overlaps or negative interactions.This program will cover the who, what, where, when, and why of medication safety. As a family caregiver, you and the care recipient are important members of the medication management team. Other key members include doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospital staff, and case managers.When you have questions about medication, the team is there to help. Some essential questions to ask include: Should this medication be taken with or without food? Are there foods to avoid (e.g., grapefruit juice with certain medications)? How long should the medication be taken, and what happens if a dose is skipped? Is the medication affordable, and are there generic alternatives? What are the potential side effects, and what should be done if they occur?Pharmacists, who know more about medications than anyone else on the team, are valuable resources. Its also crucial to keep a comprehensive and updated medication list that includes all prescriptions, over-the-counter meds, and supplements. The list should include the medication name, dosage, purpose, and potential side effects. You can update this list with your pharmacy regularly.Use pillboxes, auto-refill programs, and tools like medication therapy management (MTM) to stay organized. Monitor your loved ones emotional health while taking medications, noting changes in mood, diet, or sleep habits that might indicate a problem. In case of an emergency or hospital visit, always bring a copy of the medication list and your care recipients patient record.Medication mishaps are more likely to occur during transitions of care or changes in health conditions. Using one pharmacy for all prescriptions helps streamline care and reduce confusion. Be proactive by asking questions, monitoring your loved one for reactions, and coordinating with healthcare providers to ensure proper medication management across settings.Remember, good health outcomes are three times more likely for patients who take medications correctly compared to those who dont. This program emphasizes the importance of your role in preventing medication mishaps and ensuring your loved ones safety. Thank you for viewing this presentation.Understanding Your Role in Medication ManagementFor family caregivers, managing medications for loved ones is one of the most critical responsibilities. Studies show thatproper medication managementcan triple the likelihood of positive health outcomes.
