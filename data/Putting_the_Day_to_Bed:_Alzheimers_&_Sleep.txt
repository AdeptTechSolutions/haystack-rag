Day centers offer meals, snacks, and a variety of activities art, exercise, music, outings and the company of other people.Your loved one will likely enjoy meeting new people and will be pleasantly tired after a day or activities.While he or she is gone you can take a much-needed nap yourself!Timer for BedCreate a bedtime routine that helps your loved one prepare for a good nights sleep.Wind down at the end of the day by listening to soothing music or reading a poem or story. Make sure they use the toilet before pulling up the covers. Keep the bedroom at a comfortable temperature. Keep extra blankets handy in winter and a fan or air conditioner when the weather is warm. Install nightlights in the hall and bathroom to make it easy for your parent to find her way to the bathroom.Medications That Affect SleepPeople over 65 take more prescription and over-the-counter medications than any other age group, according to the National Institute on Aging.Its not unusual for an older person to take 14 or more different drugs each day. Side effects of both prescription and non-prescription medicines can affect sleep, especially in older adults.Some drugs may cause daytime drowsiness while others keep your relative wide awake at night.If your parent has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night or is drowsy during the day, ask the doctor or the pharmacist if her medicines could be affecting her sleep patterns. Alternative medications may be available that dont affect sleep.Medicines That Cause Drowsiness:Antihistamines for allergiesCertain blood pressure medicinesDiuretics water pills for high blood pressure and other diseasesAntidepressantsPain relievers or cough medicines containing codeineSome cold remedies and allergy productsTranquilizersCaffeine found in tea, coffee, certain soft drinks and medications that contain caffeine can keep your loved oneawake during the day and night.Limit their intake of caffeinated drinks during the day or substitute decaffeinated drinks.Alcoholic drinks can also affect sleep.Despite your best efforts, your loved one may still be unable to sleep.Their wakefulness may disturb the sleep of you and other family members.Ask the doctor if there are over-the-counter sleep medications that your loved one may use occasionally when he/she cant get to sleep. The doctor can recommend those that are most effective and have the fewest side effects.How Sleep Problems Affect CaregiversYour loved one wakes up during the night, confused and upset.They may be cold, confused or need to go to the bathroom. Youre tired from your daily round of caregiving chores and other activities but be patient and reassuring with them, lead them back to bed, tuck them in and see if you can find out whats bothering them.Remind yourself that your relative has an illness and they arent responsible for their behaviors and that you are now responsible for caring for them.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.
