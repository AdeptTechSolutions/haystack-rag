As we age, the likelihood of needing some form of long-term care increases significantly. However, financial preparation for this stage of life is often lacking. According toLongTermCare.gov, nearly 70% of people turning 65 today will need some type of long-term care in their remaining years, yet only a fraction have adequately planned for these expenses.Genworths Cost of Care Surveyhighlights the reality: the median annual cost for a private room in a nursing home in 2023 was over $100,000, and these costs are only projected to rise. This disconnect between awareness and preparation represents a looming crisis for many families.The Urgency of Addressing Long-Term Care CostsWith the Baby Boomer generation entering retirement in large numbers and the average lifespan increasing, the demographic landscape is shifting dramatically. Economic pressures, such as rising healthcare costs and inflation, further complicate the situation, placing an enormous strain on both individual households and public resources. State and federal governments are beginning to recognize the unsustainable burden of LTC costs on Medicaid and other public resources. For example, Washington State has implemented theWA Cares Fund, a public long-term care insurance program, and other states, including California and Minnesota, are exploring similar initiatives. These measures, while arguably necessary, are not enough. A comprehensive and proactive approach to long-term care is essential to reduce strain on public resources and prevent financial crises for countless families.CAN and Waterlily: Expanding Support for FamiliesCaregiver Action Network(CAN) andWaterlilydeeply understand the challenges families face when navigating the complexities of long-term care planning. Together, were committed to ensuring families can provide the best possible support for their loved ones without sacrificing their financial security.As the CEO ofCaregiver Action Network, my journey with long-term care planning has been both personal and professional. When my mother faced health challenges, I realized how easy it is to underestimate the care required and the associated expenses, even for someone with experience in aging services. My family had discussed long-term care loosely, but without a formal plan, we were fortunate to find the right support. This experience solidified my commitment to working withCANto ensure that caregivers, like myself, have access to the information and resources they need to make informed financial decisions for their loved ones. It also fuels our partnership withWaterlily, providing caregivers with a holistic, accessible approach to long-term care planning so that no family has to navigate these challenges unprepared.As the CEO ofWaterlily,long-term care planning is also deeply personal for me. At 16, I faced caregiving when my aunt, who helped raise me, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. My family was unprepared for the emotional and financial devastation that followed. Watching my aunt suffer while navigating the complexities of her care and financial responsibilities prompted me to shift my career from aerospace engineering to healthcare. This personal tragedy became the foundation of my lifes work and ultimately led to the creation ofWaterlily.AtWaterlily, we use AI to predict long-term care needs and provide families with clear, actionable steps to prepare for the future. By partnering withCAN, we aim to bridge the gap between awareness and preparation, empowering caregivers with the tools, resources, and confidence they need to navigate the complexities of aging.Read Part 2 of this series, where we will explore thecurrent reality of aging and long-term care planningin more depth.Next Steps:Be sure to read Part 2 of this series:The Realities of Aging and Gaps in Long-Term Care Planningand Part 3:Navigating Long-Term Care CostsSecure Your Spot:Novembers special access to Waterlilys innovative care planning tool saw strong community interest.
