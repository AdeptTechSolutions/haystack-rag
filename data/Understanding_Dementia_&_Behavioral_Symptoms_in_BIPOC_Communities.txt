This behavior is called sundowning. Although the exact cause is unknown, it may be due to overstimulation during the day, insufficient exposure to sunlight, tiredness or hunger, or a disturbance to your loved ones biological clock, confusing day and night.Daily Care Tips for BIPOC Dementia CaregiversAs dementia progresses, BIPOC caregivers often face additional challenges related to cultural roles, family dynamics, and access to culturally competent healthcare services. Establishing daily routines, using culturally relevant communication techniques, and incorporating traditional healing practices can enhance care quality and patient comfort.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Alzheimers.gov website has some great everyday dementia caregiver tips:Try to keep a routine, such as bathing, dressing, and eating at the same time each day.Help your loved one write down to-do lists, appointments, and events in a notebook or calendar.Plan activities that your loved one enjoys and try to do them at the same time each day.Consider a system or reminders for helping those who must take medications regularly.When dressing or bathing, allow the person to do as much as possible.Buy loose-fitting, comfortable, easy-to-use clothing, such as clothes with elastic waistbands, fabric fasteners, or large zipper pulls instead of shoelaces, buttons, or buckles.Be gentle and respectful. Tell the person what you are going to do, step by step, while you help them bathe or get dressed.Respect your loved ones privacy. Close the door or cover them with a robe when helping them bathe or get dressed.Serve meals in a consistent, familiar place and give the person enough time to eat.Managing Behavioral Changes in BIPOC CommunitiesEffective management of behavioral changes involves creating a supportive environment that respects BIPOC cultural norms and beliefs. Strategies like maintaining familiar surroundings, involving family and community elders in care decisions, and acknowledging spiritual or religious practices can help reduce agitation and promote emotional well-being.Home Safety Considerations for BIPOC Dementia PatientsEffective management of behavioral changes involves creating a supportive environment that respects BIPOC cultural norms and beliefs.Strategies like maintaining familiar surroundings, involving family and community elders in care decisions, and acknowledging spiritual or religious practices can help reduce agitation and promote emotional well-being.To reduce agitation:Create a soothing environment and remove any objects that tend to trigger the behavior.Maintain a routine and keep objects and furniture around the house in the same place.Validate your loved ones feelings. Any emotion they are feeling is very real to them.Reassure your loved one that you are there to protect them.Distraction is your best strategy.To address paranoia:If your loved one thinks that something is missing, help them look for itand then distract them with another activity.Explain to other family members and anyone else in your loved ones circle that these behaviors are all part of the diseaseand are very real to your loved one.Establish some sort of nonverbal reassurance to let your loved one know that you are there and will not let anything bad happen to them.To address sundowning:Increase your loved ones activity during the day. Discourage napping.Pay attention to your loved ones sugar and caffeine intake, particularly late in the day.Plan a relaxing, but structured activity for the late afternoon and early evening hours, like a walk outside, listening to music, or playing a game.Pay close attention to the toileting, pain, and nutrition needs of your loved one. Being uncomfortable especially if your loved one cannot communicate their discomfort can trigger these behaviors.Dont try to convince your loved one that their hallucinations or delusions are not true. It wont work and is likely to make them more agitated. Instead, acknowledge and validate their feelings.Home Safety Tips for Dementia PatientsEnsuringhome safetyfor BIPOC individuals with dementia requires addressing specific cultural needs, such as dietary preferences, mobility challenges, and traditional healing practices. Installing culturally appropriate safety features like grab bars, ensuring access to culturally relevant emergency services, and providing information in multiple languages are crucial steps.Planning for Future Care NeedsPlanning ahead in BIPOC communities involves addressing unique financial, legal, and healthcare access barriers.
