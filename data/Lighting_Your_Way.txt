Let yourself off the hook: you are not expected to know how to deal with these behaviors.We hope we can help you get through some of the panicked helplessness you felt when these symptoms first started appearing with your loved one. We want to help bring you more bright moments of joy with your loved one even as their dementia progresses.We want to help you better understand some of the symptoms that can come with dementia and what can be done about them. Yes, it may surprise you, butsomething can be doneto address certain symptoms and reduce them.What to ExpectYour Loved One's SymptomsWhat to Tell the DoctorHow You Can Help at HomeSelf CareWhat to ExpectThere can be lots of symptoms associated with dementia. Everyone seems to be familiar with symptoms like memory loss and confusion. There can also be symptoms like difficulty getting dressed, or bathing, or paying bills.Lets now shed the light on a whole other category of symptoms. Symptoms such asagitationandaggression. Symptoms such ashallucinationsanddelusions.Doctors call these the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. But dont worry about the medical termseven the professionals dont use the medical terms very consistently. These are symptoms that include things like agitation, anxiety, elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes.You know it when you see it. Your loved one might be constantly pacing. They might be verbally abusive. They might be throwing things. They might be seeing things that are not really there. They might have paranoid feelings that everyone is out to get them.Your Loved Ones SymptomsWhat are examples of these behavioral symptoms?What Is Agitation and Aggressive Behavior?What are hallucinations?What are delusions/paranoia?What causes this behavior?What else could it be?What are examples of these behavioral symptoms?We want to put certain behaviors on your caregiver radar so that you can recognize them as symptoms associated with dementiabehaviors such as agitation, delusions/paranoia, hallucinations, and aggression.These behaviors can be commonly associated with Alzheimers disease. But your loved one doesnt have to have Alzheimers to have these symptoms. There are other conditions that involve these same behaviors. These symptoms can occur in many types of dementias, including Alzheimers disease, Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinsons Disease Dementia, and Vascular Dementia.OK. So then what should I be looking for?Specifically, signs of agitation or instances of aggressive behavior.Whether your loved is experiencing hallucinations or delusions/paranoiaWhat Is Agitation and Aggressive Behavior?Agitation can be rapidchanges in mood, irritability, and outbursts.It can beexcessive motor activitylike pacing, rocking, gesturing, restlessness, and performing repetitious mannerisms.It can also beverbal aggressionsuch as yelling, speaking in an excessively loud voice, using profanity, screaming, and shouting.Or it can bephysical aggressionlike grabbing, shoving, pushing, resisting, hitting others, kicking objects or people, scratching, biting, throwing objects, hitting oneself, and destroying property.The behavior has been persistent or frequent for a minimum of two weeks and represents a change from your loved ones usual behavior(and is not related to some other medical condition such as delirium, pain, effects of a medication, or infection such as a urinary tract infection.).What are hallucinations?Hallucinations are any sensations of something that does not actually exist in reality.Many people think hallucinations are only visualseeing something that is not really there. But in fact, hallucinations can involve any or all the five sensessight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.While people with dementia can experience hallucinations of any of the five senses,visual hallucinations are the most common.People can experience hallucinations at any point in the progression of dementia, from early in the disease cycle to later in the disease cycle.Some common hallucinations are: seeing strangers whos that man in the living room?; hearing things someone is talking outside of the bedroom; and seeing deceased relativesmy mother is sitting in that chair.What are delusions/paranoia?Delusions are fixed ideas about something that is not true.Some examples ofcommon delusionsare:theftthey are stealing my things;abandonmentyou never come to see me, are yougoing to leave me?;spousal infidelityyoure having an affair; andreferencethey are talking about me in the news again.What causes this behavior?These behaviors are simply a part of the dementia. No, your loved one is not going crazy. Their behavior is just a result of the underlying medical condition.Sure, the symptoms might be embarrassing, difficult to deal with, even on rare occasions dangerousbut they are symptoms of an illness just like any other medical condition.Andthese behaviors are not at all uncommon.Of the 8 million Americans with dementia, 75% of them will experience these symptoms during the course of the disease.What else could it be?Actually, there are a lot of things other than dementia that can cause symptoms like agitation, hallucinations, and delusions.Certainmedicationscan cause these symptoms.Certainmedical conditionscan cause them, too, such as narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, and mental conditions such as schizophrenia. Even common conditions like urinary tract infections can cause these symptoms.Grief or emotional traumacan cause symptoms. Even excessive exercise has been known to spark symptoms.If your loved one abusesdrugs or alcoholor is going through recovery, you might see these symptoms.Covid-19can cause symptoms such as olfactory hallucinations (smelling things that arent there.)What Should I Tell the DoctorAbout hallucinations andneuropsychiatric/behavioral dementia?Hallucinationsand anyother symptoms of neuropsychiatric/behavioral dementia: such as aggression, agitation, delusions, or paranoiashould be reported to your loved ones doctor so he/she can determine the cause.Because symptoms such as agitation, aggressive behavior, and hallucinations can be the result of different causes, it is important that you describe the symptoms asaccurately and fullyas you can to the doctor.You will want to tell the doctor:what the symptoms arehow often they occurhow long they have been happeningif they are changing in severityif there are any triggers you observe that seem to bring on the symptoms.Remember that these symptoms can occur at any time during the stages of dementianot just in the later stages of dementia.But why bother? Can we actually do anything about these behaviors?These behavioral and psychological changes in dementiapose challengesand canincrease the progressioninto a more severe declinewhich is why it is important to tell the doctor when these symptoms happen.These behaviors can certainly be very hard for you as a caregiver to handle and can easily lead to burnout and stress.Many family caregivers think these behaviors are just part of dementia and shrug their shoulders, thinking that nothing can be done about them.The fact is, more can be done to deal with these behaviors than you might think. Your loved ones behavior issomething that can be dealt with, not justsomething to endure.When I talk to the doctor, what will the doctor do?The doctor will first try to determine if the symptoms are associated with dementia. The doctor will want to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. As some doctors say, properly addressing issues of toileting, pain, and nutrition can help resolve symptoms like anxiety and aggression in many cases.If the doctor does determine that the symptoms are part of your loved ones dementia, there are several approaches the doctor might take.The doctor might want to start with any number of non-pharmacological approaches to treatment before considering medication. Non-pharmacological approaches can include music therapy, aromatherapy, and many others. These therapies can be very effective in many cases.The doctor might decide medications are necessary.Medications may help address some of these symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which type of medications may be right for your loved one. It is important to understand the potential side effects of medications.I'm not sure I want my loved one on even more medications. Is there an alternative?There are several therapies that do not involve medications. In fact, your loved ones doctor may start thesenon-pharmacological therapiesfirst before prescribing a medication.These include music therapy, aromatherapy, bright light therapy, massage, and exercise.Will medications just sedate the patient and knock them out? Or can medications actually help treat the symptoms?Some medications, such asbenzodiazepines, can be sedating without much efficacy in addressing the symptoms.Antipsychoticscan be sedating but can help resolve some symptoms is some patients. Doctors may prescribe antipsychotics for short-term use.New therapies are being studied to specifically address the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Hopefully, there will be FDA approved medicines soon.What other healthcare professionals besides my loved ones doctor are involved?In addition to your loved ones primary care provider, any number of other health care professionals might be involved with your loved ones care.These can include psychiatrists, neurologists, geriatricians, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, or case managers. Each have their own expertise.Keep in mind that other health care professionals besides the primary care doctor can be very helpful in addressing your loved ones behavioral symptoms. For example, geriatric psychiatrists and geriatric nurses have a great deal of helpful expertise and are accustomed to interacting with family caregivers. Ask your loved ones primary care doctor if there is a geriatric psychiatrist or geriatric nurse that they can refer you to.What Can I Do At Home to Help?Upgrade & Improve Environment & HomeCreate a soothing environment.Decrease noise. Decrease brightness.Remove any objects that tend to trigger the behavior.Be aware of whether mirrored surfaces or poor lighting that causes shadows contribute to your loved ones hallucinations, and if so, remove those, too.Pay close attentionto the toileting, pain, and nutrition needs of your loved one. Being uncomfortable especially if your loved one cannot communicate their discomfort can trigger these behaviors.Validate your loved ones feelings.After all, the fear or anger or other emotions they feel are very real.Reassure your loved one that you are there to protect them.Distraction,distraction, distraction! Trying to distract your loved one is your best strategy.Change the subject.Take your loved one for a walk.Play a game or work a puzzle.Sing a favorite song.Listen to musicShould I try to convince my loved one that their hallucinations or delusions are not real?Probably not. Telling your loved one that they are wrong and arguing with them about it is likely just to aggravate your loved one even more.Some health professionals say, if it causes no harm to you or your loved one, the best approach is to just go along with it.You can acknowledge and validate your loved ones feelings without trying to convince your loved one that what they are feeling or experiencing is not true.This is Hard. Can I handle it? What can help me from going crazy handling all this?Emotional & Physical Stress & Risk for DepressionFamily caregivers of people with dementia can experience high rates ofemotional and physical stress.The burden of caring for a loved one with dementia is one of the major reasons family caregivers consider placing their loved ones in long-term care.Because of the stress of your role as a family caregiver, you might be atincreased risk for depressionas well as an increased likelihood of conditions such ashigh blood pressure.So it is critical that you take care of yourself so that you can stay strong enough to care for your loved one.Get rest when you can.
