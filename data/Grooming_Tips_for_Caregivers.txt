It is important to try to allow your loved one to perform grooming tasks on their own, with your supervision as needed, for as long as they safely can. When your loved one can no longer properly groom themselves, use these tips to help them out.Tips for GroomingStick to a regular grooming routine. This is especially important if your loved one has dementia. Use your loved ones favorite toiletries, but make sure theyre safe and simple to use: for example, cardboard nail files are less threatening than metal nail clippers.Most people like having their hair washed regularly. Many people enjoy the feeling of having their hair washed and feel better when it is done. However, some people dont enjoy it at all. If frequent hair washing creates tension between you and the person you are caring for, consider the advantages of clean hair. Weigh these against the disadvantages of creating that tension.Going to the hairdresser or barber regularly gives your loved one a routine to stick to. This can be especially beneficial if its something theyve regularly done for a long time. Visiting the hairdresser routinely also prevents the need to wash their hair at home as frequently. Or find a hairdresser who will come to the house. This may be a time when you can have your hair cut too. Stick with haircuts that are easy for you and your loved one to maintain.If you are washing the persons hair yourself, a hand-held shower hose may work best. Think about using a shampoo that will not sting if it gets into the persons eyes. Alternatively, consider using a hair wash shield to prevent water from running onto the persons face. Another option is a no rinse shampoo that can clean the hair without using water.When it comes to assisting your loved one with hair removal, it is easiest and safest to use an electric razor. For hard to reach spots like the nose or ears, plucking normally works best.Its important to clip your loved ones fingernails and toenails regularly. This will prevent them from accidentally scratching themselves. Watch out for bunions, corns, or severe cracking when youre tending to your loved ones feet.A little makeup can go a long way. This may seem like an unnecessary luxury for your loved one. However, if they always used makeup in the past, even a little foundation and lipstick can make your loved one feel like a new person.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.
